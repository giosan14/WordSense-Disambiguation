**Description:**

This laboratory involves developing and implementing different supervised machine learning algorithms to disambiguate the meaning of words in Python, using the open-source software tool NLTK.

To prepare for this laboratory, download and install NLTK 3.3 on your computer. NLTK requires Python versions 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6 to function, so make sure you have Python installed as well.

During the laboratory session, a problem of word sense disambiguation using the tagged English corpus Senseval 2, available in NLTK, is solved. The ambiguous words "hard" and "serve" are the focus of this exercise.

Detailed instructions are provided on how to analyze the corpus, including determining the number of possible senses for the ambiguous words, identifying senses for each word, and extracting features for training classifiers.

**Parts of the Laboratory:**

1. **Corpus Analysis:**
   - Analyze the Senseval 2 corpus for the words "hard" and "serve".
   - Determine the number of possible senses and identify senses for each word.
   - Examine the different grammatical forms in which they appear in context.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Extract features based on neighboring words and collocation features for corpus instances.

3. **Classifier Training:**
   - Train a Naive Bayes classifier to disambiguate the words "hard" and "serve".
   - Evaluate classifier performance using training and test sets.
